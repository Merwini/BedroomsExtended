Change vanilla room traits to use new moodlet system
	Greedy - Requires an extra desire option to be met per each tier (4/5?)

	Ascetic - will use a separate set of desires? 
Custom traits and/or genes
	fewer desire slots per tier
	more desire slots per tier
	fewer desire options per tier
	more desire options per tier
Make a Debug tool to regenerate a pawn's desires

Display cases, with custom float menu option for objects to place in a targeted display case?

	Tier 0 (-4):
		nothing

	Tier 1 (0):
		Bedroom
