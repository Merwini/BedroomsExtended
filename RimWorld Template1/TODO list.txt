Add step to whatever calculates room stats to check for specific conditions
	to reduce overhead:
		store value of room wealth
		on a rare tick, if wealth != stored value, run the individual item check, then update the wealth stored value
Add gizmo to objects in a bedroom to display requirements. Or maybe add to the pawn?
Add comp to pawns to track their desires
	find a way to add this to existing pawns, so it is savegame compatible
Change moodlet to check room desires instead of default impressiveness
	There will be tiers of desires, and each pawn will generate X desires for each tier. Moodlet will upgrade if Y desires for that tier are satisfied (3/5?)
	Higher-tier desires will be weighted to favor upgraded forms of lower-tier desires, then trait-related desires, then randomly selected ones
Change vanilla room traits to use new moodlet system
	Greedy - Requires an extra desire option to be met per each tier (4/5?)
	Jealous - Unhappy if anyone has a higher moodlet tier
	Ascetic - will use a separate set of desires? 
Custom traits and/or genes
	fewer desire slots per tier
	more desire slots per tier
	fewer desire options per tier
	more desire options per tier
Make a Def for room desires, so they are xml-configured
	Mood tier
	upgradesFrom
	upgradesTo
Make a Debug tool to regenerate a pawn's desires

Display cases, with custom float menu option for objects to place in a targeted display case?
	maybe not worth it
